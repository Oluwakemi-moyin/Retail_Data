### Project Overview

Collection and analysis of online sales data across the company's various sales regions(countries). The goal of the project is to analyse the trends and the breakdown by different categories so as to give clarity on how the revenue is being generated and what are the main factors affecting the online store over a two year-period and also provide insights which the company can use to create the expansion strategy.

2. There are opportunities for expansion in these regions; Netherlands, Eire and Germany.
3. Customers 14646, 18102 and 17450 are the top 3 customers, they should be given gifts at the end of the year for best patronage.

   to further increase Total sales and as a result, Total revenue.
5. Hen House w chick in nest should be reviewed for possible removal from products list due to poor order in the year.
