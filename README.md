### Project Overview
---
Collection and analysis of online sales data across the company's various sales regions(countries). The goal of the project is to analyse the trends and the breakdown by different categories so as to give clarity on how the revenue is being generated and what are the main factors affecting the online store over a two year-period and also provide insights which the company can use to create the expansion strategy. The analysis focuses on understanding sales performance and revenue trends across various regions and calculating important performance indicators like average revenue and average quantity sold per region/country. 
    
### Data Source
---

---    
This data contains some key columns.
1. Country/Region : The geographical area/city where the store operates.
2. Quantity: The number of units sold per transaction.
3. Unit Price: The price per unit item
4. Revenue: The total monetary value generated from each sale. Calculated as: Revenue = Unit Price*Quantity
5. Trade date: The date/time period the sales were made.
  
  
### Project Objective  
--- 
This project is to address the following analysis goals.
1. Revenue per Country/Region: Determines the total revenue generated by each region/country
2. Quantity sold per Region/Country: Determines the total units sold by each region/country
3. Average Revenue per Region/Country: shows the average revenue generated by each region/country to assess performance.

### Key Metrics
---
1. Total Revenue: calculated by multiplying the unit price of each item by the total units sold for the item and summing them up.
2. Total Quantity Sold: Group the data by region and sum the units sold to identify how much each region sold per year/month/day/fiscal period.
3. Average Revenue: It is used to measure the amount of money a business earns, on average, for each unit of product it sells. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue(TR) a company makes from all its sales by the number of units sold.

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
1. Microsoft Excel:
   - Power Query : used for cleaning the dataset.
   - Calculation: Revenue
     ```
     Revenue = Quantity * Unit Price
     ```
2. Power BI :
   - for Summarisation of the dataset and
   - for Visualisations.
